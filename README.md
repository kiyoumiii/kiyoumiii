I graduated from Jilin University with a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering a couple of years ago, and I was honored to be admitted to Nanjing University’s Kuang Yaming Honors College / Institute of Brain Science through a recommendation program. I’m also a member of the Mind Development and Brain Function Lab at Nanjing University. Currently, I’m in my second year of graduate school, focusing on brain science and artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on generative AI for protein structure design. Meanwhile, I’m working hard to transition into becoming a fantastic front-end developer!

### More About Me👇

I am a serial entrepreneur and have been involved in development roles at two AI startup companies over the past two years.

👌OK简历 [okjob](https://okjob.linchance.com/)

- 2024 拯救者杯OPENAIGC开发者大赛 高校组特等奖
- 2024 第二届中国生成式AI应用创新挑战赛 大学生及个人开发者组 全国Top9

Given the limited resources in startup companies, I took on multiple roles in both companies. At the first company, besides being a front-end developer, I also handled product management and operations. At the second company, I served as both a front-end developer engineer and a test developer engineer.



### More Early💫

A few years ago, I interned as a product manager (PM) at Baidu, but due to personal choices, I have decided to transition to a technical role.
