I graduated from Jilin University with a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering a couple of years ago, and I was honored to be admitted to Nanjing University’s Kuang Yaming Honors College / Institute of Brain Science through a recommendation program. I’m also a member of the Mind Development and Brain Function Lab at Nanjing University. Currently, I’m in my second year of graduate school, In our Scientific Intelligence Research Group, I lead the research direction of AI for BioPhysics, focusing on brain science and artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on generative AI for protein structure design. Meanwhile, I’m working hard to transition into becoming a fantastic front-end developer!

### More About Me👇


**Update**: Recently, I've been knee-deep in developing a super cool WeChat mini-program😎! It's called "百无禁忌", and it's just brimming with traditional aesthetics and a sense of mystery✨. This is a self-learning mini-program focused on traditional Chinese culture. Here, you can explore knowledge systems like Ziwei Star Astrology（紫微星斗）, Liuren Divination（六壬）, and Plum Blossom Divination（梅花易数）🧐, which are all part of traditional Chinese culture or even the mysterious world of metaphysics. It's a mini - program that uses AI to build its knowledge base, a real - deal large - model application development project👏. Every fortune-teller out there, we warmly welcome you to join in and experience it for yourself🎉!

I am a serial entrepreneur and have been involved in development roles at two AI startup companies over the past two years. These companies are ShengSheng Technology, which focuses on consciousness uploading in digital life, and LinCheng Technology, which is dedicated to using AI technology to address employment difficulties. I welcome you to experience the two products that I have developed!

Based on the Minimax's digital life dialogue model 5.5s, we support users in customizing their own personalized digital life. We strongly encourage everyone to create a digital avatar for themselves, uploading your experiences, memories, and works. Your digital avatar will become increasingly similar to you over time, and simultaneously, you can treat the platform as your life's database!

(Tips: So Sorry! The currently deployed version 2.0.0 has recently encountered some issues.The team is unable to find a suitable profit point and has not done a good job with maintenance. I may deploy and showcase version 1.0.0 in my personal time.)

They cannot be open-sourced yet, but everyone is welcome to use them and provide feedback!

Given the limited resources in startup companies, I took on multiple roles in both companies. At the first company, besides being a front-end developer, I also handled product management and operations. At the second company, I served as both a front-end developer engineer and a test developer engineer.


### My Research Exp 🔮

My scientific research project: DEDGS, is an enhanced sampling method based on generative models, applicable to the study of protein molecular dynamics. In 2024, Nobel Prize-winning AlphaFold can provide accurate structural predictions, but it is merely an effective tool for static structures and is powerless in exploring dynamic change processes such as protein folding trajectories. I focus on enhanced sampling methods to address the scientific issue of dynamic change pathways. This method combines traditional computational simulations with contemporary generative artificial intelligence, making it a genuinely innovative endeavor!



### More Early💫

A few years ago, I once worked as a product manager(PM) intern at Baidu and its subsidiary companies. but due to personal choices, I have decided to transition to a technical role.
