I graduated from Jilin University with a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering a couple of years ago, and I was honored to be admitted to Nanjing University’s Kuang Yaming Honors College / Institute of Brain Science through a recommendation program. I’m also a member of the Mind Development and Brain Function Lab at Nanjing University. Currently, I’m in my second year of graduate school, focusing on brain science and artificial intelligence, with a particular emphasis on generative AI for protein structure design. Meanwhile, I’m working hard to transition into becoming a fantastic front-end developer!

### More About Me👇

I am a serial entrepreneur and have been involved in development roles at two AI startup companies over the past two years. These companies are ShengSheng Technology, which focuses on consciousness uploading in digital life, and LinCheng Technology, which is dedicated to using AI technology to address employment difficulties. I welcome you to experience the two products that I have developed!

(Tips: So Sorry! The currently deployed version 2.0.0 has recently encountered some issues.The team is unable to find a suitable profit point and has not done a good job with maintenance. I may deploy and showcase version 1.0.0 in my personal time.)

👌OK简历 [okjob](https://okjob.linchance.com/)

A good resume will safeguard your professional journey.



Given the limited resources in startup companies, I took on multiple roles in both companies. At the first company, besides being a front-end developer, I also handled product management and operations. At the second company, I served as both a front-end developer engineer and a test developer engineer.



### More Early💫

A few years ago, I interned as a product manager (PM) at Baidu, but due to personal choices, I have decided to transition to a technical role.
